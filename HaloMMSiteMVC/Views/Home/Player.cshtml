        <h3><u>Search Times</u></h3>
        The first time searching a particular Gamertag can take up to ~7 minutes. After the first search the Gamertag will be added to the database
        and subsequent searches with be much faster (10-30 seconds in most cases).

        <br />
        <h3><u>Requirements</u></h3>
        - You need to use <b>current</b> Gamertag of the Xbox Live accounts you're trying to search.<br />
        - Games played after 03/31/2012 aren't available. Bungie did not record Halo 3 games played after this date. <br />
        - Search is not case sensitive. <br />
